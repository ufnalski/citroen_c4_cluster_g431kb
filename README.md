# Citroen C4 II B7 (2011) instrument panel cluster hacking (STM32G431KB)
Oops!... I Did It Again :sunglasses: Almost the same story as for the [Citroen  C5 II X7 IPC](https://github.com/ufnalski/citroen_c5_cluster_g431kb). Let me therefore not to retell the story here.

There is a fine line between a well-designed instrument panel cluster and a true piece of art :art:

# Citroen C4 IPC hacking - I'm not the first one
* [Reverse Engineering licznika samochodowego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uGUtiS9Tww) (Systemy Wbudowane) - That video made me buy this particular IPC. Thank you, Wojciech Kochański :wink:

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32G4xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.
